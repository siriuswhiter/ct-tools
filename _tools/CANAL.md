## Abstract

A unified modeling framework for non-functional properties of a program is
essential for research in software analysis and verification, since it reduces
burdens on individual researchers to implement new approaches and compare
existing approaches. We present CANAL, a framework that models the cache
behaviors of a program by transforming its intermediate representation in the
LLVM compiler. CANAL inserts auxiliary variables and instructions over these
variables, to allow standard verification tools to handle a new class of cache
related properties, e.g., for computing the worst-case execution time and
detecting side-channel leaks.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of using three verification tools: KLEE,
SMACK and Crab-llvm. We confirm the accuracy of our cache model by comparing
with CPU cycle-accurate simulation results of GEM5.
