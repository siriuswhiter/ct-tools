## Constant-timeness verification tools

This repository contains a list of tools for testing and verification of constant-timeness of programs.
The list is based mostly on the work in [*“They’re not that hard to mitigate”: What Cryptographic Library Developers Think About Timing Attacks*](https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/usablect_sp22) with addition of more tools. 
See [the page](https://crocs-muni.github.io/ct-tools/) for more.
